Working together and understanding that people, and all of who they are comes first. It's a simple formula, nurture and take care of people and the returns are massive. All of our people are aligned to who and what matters to U Parallel, they believe and live our mission everyday.

We're able to support ourselves, others and most importantly hold boundaries. Ethical practice is the cornerstone of any coaching relationship, and something that falls under a coach's BPS Code of Ethics. U Parallel will never feed anything back from a session to anyone, ever. The only exception to this rule is if we believe that an individual is at immediate risk of harming themselves or someone else.</p>
